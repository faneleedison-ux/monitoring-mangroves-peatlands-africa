# Monitoring Forests, Peatlands, and Mangroves in Africa

This project focuses on monitoring and mapping **forests, peatlands, and mangroves** across Africa using remote sensing data and machine learning methods. These ecosystems are critical for climate regulation, carbon capture, and coastal protection, yet they remain under-monitored on the continent.

---

## 🌍 Project Objectives
- Monitor the **evolution of peatlands and mangroves** over time.  
- Develop **machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for mapping and classification.  
- Generate a **map inventory** of mangrove forests and peatlands.  
- Support **real-time monitoring solutions** for conservation efforts.  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Use **satellite imagery** (Landsat, Sentinel-2, GeoMAD).  
- Apply **Random Forest classifiers** for peatland and mangrove detection.  
- Perform **feature importance analysis** and correlation studies.  
- Improve models by incorporating data from more African countries.
