# Monitoring Mangroves and Peatlands in Africa

Part of NRF & SARAO (South African Radio Astronomy Observatory) Research

This project focuses on monitoring the evolution of mangroves and peatlands in Africa. It also aims to develop a model to identify areas that have not yet been monitored, contributing to efforts to reduce CO₂ levels and protect the Earth.

---

## Features

- Track the changes and evolution of mangroves and peatlands over time
- Identify unmonitored areas for further observation
- Support environmental research and conservation initiatives

---

## Data

The repository includes:

- KN_Mangroves.geojson – Geospatial data for mangrove locations
- peatlands.geojson – Geospatial data for peatlands
- Mangrove_Analysis.ipynb – Jupyter notebook for analyzing mangrove and peatland data

---

## Objective

- Monitor ecosystem evolution to detect changes over time
- Provide actionable insights for environmental conservation
- Support NRF & SARAO research initiatives and global CO₂ reduction efforts

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/faneleedison-ux/monitoring-mangroves-peatlands-africa.git
2. Open Mangrove_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3. Run the analysis on the provided geojson datasets
4. Explore and modify the code to adapt to other regions or datasets

---

## Future Work

- Integrate machine learning models to predict unmonitored mangrove and peatland areas
- Include real-time satellite imagery for dynamic monitoring
- Expand to other ecosystems for broader environmental impact
